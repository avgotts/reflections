When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating with other people, or using multiple computers to edit a project.
When you want to share your work with others, even if they aren't contributing.


Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To keep track of where you are and what you are doing. 
If someone else makes a change, it might cause issues with what you're trying to do.
