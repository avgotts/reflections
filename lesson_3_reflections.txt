When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating with other people, or using multiple computers to edit a project.
When you want to share your work with others, even if they aren't contributing.


Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To keep track of where you are and what you are doing. 
If someone else makes a change, it might cause issues with what you're trying to do.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones on GitHub. You can change the files there without changing the original copy.
You can add your own features while the creator can still do their own thing.
Clones are copying entire repositories.
They can be used to collaborate on a project.
Branches are splitting an existing repository.
It can be used to try new features, or to keep a production-value version while making changed.
